CI/CD Pipeline Project with Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Ansible, Graphite, and Grafana
Overview
This project demonstrates a robust CI/CD pipeline for a Java application, integrating automated build, test, containerization, deployment, and real-time monitoring.
Tools used:

Git – Version control

Jenkins – CI/CD orchestration

Maven – Build automation and dependency management

JUnit – Java unit testing

Docker – Containerization

Ansible – Automated deployment

Graphite – Metrics collection and storage

Grafana – Metrics visualization

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Docker & Docker Compose

Java & Maven

Jenkins (can be installed or run in Docker)

Ansible

Graphite & Grafana (preferably via Docker)

Git

1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. Jenkins Setup
Install Jenkins and required plugins: Pipeline, Docker, Ansible, JUnit, etc.

Configure Maven and Docker in Jenkins global tool configuration.

Add your Jenkinsfile to the repository root.

3. Graphite & Grafana Setup
Start Graphite and Grafana using Docker Compose:

bash
docker-compose up -d
Access Graphite (usually at http://localhost:8082) and Grafana (http://localhost:3000).

In Grafana, add Graphite as a data source.

Create dashboards/panels for your metrics.

4. Ansible Setup
Ensure SSH access to your deployment target.

Edit ansible/inventory.ini and ansible/deploy.yml as needed for your environment.

Usage
Make a code change and push to Git.

Jenkins will automatically:

Checkout code

Build with Maven

Run JUnit tests

Build Docker image

Deploy with Ansible

Send metrics to Graphite

View metrics and dashboards in Grafana.

Pipeline Stages
Stage	Description
Checkout	Gets code from Git
Build	Runs mvn clean package
Test	Runs mvn test and publishes JUnit results
Dockerize	Builds Docker image
Deploy	Deploys using Ansible
Send Metrics	Sends build/test metrics to Graphite
