# Library Management System â€“ CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates a robust **CI/CD pipeline** for a Java-based Library Management System. The pipeline automates building, testing, containerizing, deploying, and monitoring the application using industry-standard DevOps tools.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Checkout**: Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub.
2. **Build**: Maven compiles and packages the Java application.
3. **Test**: JUnit tests are run; results are recorded in Jenkins.
4. **Dockerize**: Docker builds an image from the JAR file.
5. **Deploy**: Ansible deploys the Docker container to the server.
6. **Monitoring**: Metrics are sent to Graphite and visualized in Grafana.
